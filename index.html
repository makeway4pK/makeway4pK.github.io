		Hey Shravani!
		<br>This will be the Homepage, ok?
		you can make any other files/folders you need.

		<br>And Yeah, quick update: to invoke vscode's command palette(from where we Git:Clone and others), There's two
		options:
		<li>Ctrl+Shift+P</li>
		<li>F1 (the help key; It's Actually useful in this editor)</li>
		Also, Try out the HTML autocomplete and emmett completion that's
		<br> in-built to vscode, I think you'll like it.
		<br>
